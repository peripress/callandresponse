I held a week-old baby in my arms while she slept. The baby was not my baby in that I did not give her birth, but to this baby I felt a sense of deep be longing. I was holding this baby, which was like and not like holding my own bab(y)ies, who are not bab(y)ies anymore, in that holding a baby can feel like moving back and forth through time. It is like being in all times all at once. And also stopping time. I was holding this baby and this baby was holding me. What I mean is that holding this baby was a little like holding myself as a baby. Bonnie calls this baby, the baby who is me, my "baby self." We all sometimes need to hold our baby baby selves. I do not know who held me as a baby, but someone did and whoever it was who held me as a baby is not with me anymore. Hey baby, hi baby, my baby baby baby. Sometimes I call people I love baby, and sometimes people I love call me baby or hold me while I sleep. I love all the little babies we are. The sad and sweet and hungry and grumpy and sleepy little babies. People who are dying now were once babies. Everyone who dies or has died was once a baby. Dying makes us think that time works only in one way, but I think it works many ways all at once. I am still my baby self and my baby self is still me. Maybe the same is true for you.


Someone I loved who died was once a baby and, one baby that this person loved is also someone I love. Sometimes I hold him while he sleeps and I call him baby, but very softly so when he wakes up maybe he thinks that it was part of his dream. Or maybe he thinks, just for a moment, that he is a baby again, his baby self, being held in the arms of the person who died, who loved him when he was a baby and with whom he felt a deep, deep sense of be longing. Someone who held me and with whom I wanted, but did not always feel a deep sense of be longing died. She died a long time ago, and sometimes it feels like a very long time, but sometimes it doesn't feel like much time has passed at all, but when she died, I was not able to hold her, but I was able to watch her sleep. Watching someone sleep can sometimes remind you that they were once babies, sleeping in the arms of someone who loved them. I don't know why I am thinking so much about babies, but maybe it is because when someone dies, some of the things they leave behind remind us that they were not always the way they were when they died. That they weren't always frail or sick or tired or broken or maybe there were those things too, but that they were also so many other things and that some of those things were part of their baby baby selves and some of those things they accumulated along the way.
