i wore your death like a goose wears its feathers 

<Spacer></Spacer> embedded and seeking to be plucked 

the plumeria tucked behind my ear dripped milk down my neck 

<Spacer></Spacer> and you were with me even then with the sun casting light 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> over brown skin, illuminating it to pale and forcing 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer>dark shadows where i faced away from you 

i wore your dress like a man wears his skin 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> comfortably at rest, then writhing for release 

the red and white lace eyelets peered into my nakedness 

<Spacer></Spacer> how could i ll a place made for someone else someone 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> more lovely and loved than my empty bag of bones 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> i rolled you around in my mouth-- a marble 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> pushing the question of tragedy with my tongue 

<div class="rightalign">
careful not to swallow

<Spacer></Spacer> in the pictures, we are wearing you 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> with plumerias tucked into bruised black hair 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> sun painting us colors we are not 

<Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> <Spacer></Spacer> and the man behind the camera cries 

<div class="rightalign">
for a girl who may have looked much like us.

	September 1, 2003—I had always thought politics was a matter of manners, not ethics. So I was not struck by the indifference I felt that autumn of 1971 when I saw Hirohito waving to a crowd of Japanese school children in front of the Louvre. L had canceled our lunch plans. And I had already skipped my philosophy course to meet her across the city. The weather was warm for the season, the leaves pristine in their final moments. I remember the scene as if from a dream. The miniature Japanese flags the children waved, their strong teeth bared to the wind, ceaselessly smiling. Where did they come from? The children, that is. Where were their parents? A woman dressed in all black lunged forward from the crowd screaming, “Hirohito, where is my father?” in Korean. That startled me. The shape of those words unfurling from her lips, vibrating through the air until they reached my ears, was disconcerting. I wanted to see her face. With her back still turned to me, two French military police caught her in the air and dragged her away. I analyzed her stature, height, age, those physical attributes that tend to define a person, and concluded that she could have been my mother. Hirohito continued waving at the school children. The school children continued waving their flags. I remember little else of this day. The sunlight filtering through the yellow green leaves of magnolia trees. The smell of chestnuts on the nearby street. Pale blue of the sky.
