She is a wheel of fire, a jovial dancing saint
<br /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer />banished
<br />to the seven spheres, the cauldron whirling below
 
earth’s parched lip – recycled, bone boiled, made clean
 
<Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /> begot of serpents, figs, sacraments of flesh,
 
<Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer />purged with soot and saltwater now
<br /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer />cartwheeling
<br />naked across the<Spacer />continental<Spacer />shelf
 
<Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer />where the fathers of order
<br /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer />have taken their robes to the laundry,
<br /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer />and frenzied, themselves to the sea
<br />flocking at the shore in exhilaratory hysteria,
<br /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer /><Spacer />or “a nostalgia for boyhood, and the womb”

<CandRItem id="response" title={frontmatter.responsetitle} author={frontmatter.responseauthor}>


Because I ask how much of me <br />
you’ll swallow, I am drowning. <br />
Trapped in the physics of doing the undoing.<br />
A life carved in reef, womb empty.<br />
The still life of warfare is a *magi* twirling.<br />
You thought I could not hear your murder coming.<br />
That the cauldron once brimming with boiled tongue<br />
would make me question the water’s raw edge.<br />
All water has a temper. & the earth does not spare<br />
its wrath either. Replenishes itself –  bone, gelatinous blood. <br />
Call it hysteria: the sea congregating<br />
at the shoreline, pretending to carry this life in its jaws<br />
for your ceremony, opening its mouth instead <br />
for what earth is ready to hurl.
