Contractors from the towing company use Coca-Cola to clean
<br />traffic collisions. The timing of the soak needs to be exact, 

just enough to wash off blood but not enough to strip paint. 
<br />I wonder if the workers ever pour one out for the spills

no longer belonging to a body. I’d like to believe so, 
<br />perhaps not every time, but on the occasions the moon is full 

& the street lights are flickering; while the wax is still unlit;
<br />before the flowers get taped to bicycles & the street signs

become headstones; & in anticipation of the wind blowing 
<br />out candles & the vigil being delivered an ultimatum

of police sirens: evaporate or solidify. Regardless, Our Lady 
<br />of Guadalupe would still cry with molten tears. She holds

photographs in memoriam & the ink never dries—
<br />framed in roses that never wither because our departed 

don’t have names here. I ask the teacher, when she says a nail 
<br />can dissolve in Coke, does she mean a human being’s?
