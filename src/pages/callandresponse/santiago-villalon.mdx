My dead grandfather, I was told, was almost killed one night while descending from the sierra, plodding over the bumpy lomas to get home. It was very late and it was particularly dark, barely able to make out whatever markers—a certain tree, a crumbling fence—would guide him through the dry slopes leading to the clothes line and chicken coop behind the house he tried to spend as little time in as possible.

He may well have been drunk. Up in the sierra, you can get all kinds of agua ardiente, sold to you in emptied-out soda bottles, stoppered with a thumb of sugarcane. And up in the sierra, if a man chose to, he could do some things that might never be known to anybody in town. He was trying to steady his pace, resisting the lunatic urge to let gravity whoosh him down the steep dirt paths and fly into a gloriously delirious run and be done with all the mincing steps and finally be in his bed, his desolate marital bed. And that would mean eventually waking up to an empty pantry, stony looks from his teen son, his little daughters’ frantic glee, the unimpeachable presence of his wife—so what was the rush? Take your time. And that’s when he saw him. The man was blocking the path. His face couldn’t be seen, not just because of the dark but because he was wearing a wide-brim hat. He appeared more shape than person. 

You’re going the wrong way, the man said. Where you’re going there’s a ravine. You won’t see it till it’s too late. But how could that be? What ravine? Yet the sierra could be treacherous. You think you know all its caves and waterfalls and deep pools but there’s more out there than you’ll ever know. Some are hidden things that when suddenly revealed you’ll think, Of course, of course, and then you’re no more. 

Go that way, the man said. His voice alone pointed where to look and yes, where the yerba fronds bowed and where fist-sized rocks clumped the ground, their dimensions clear even under the drizzle of moonlight; there was a footpath, familiar yet alien. 

Te lo agradezco, primo. What’s your name? The man told him, but he didn’t recognize it. Que le vaya bien, the man told him. My grandfather took the path, and though it proved to be an unfamiliar route his instincts told him he was going the right way and soon enough he saw the silhouettes of the clothes-line poles and the rhombus of the coop and made his way to the back door, his shoes dust-coated. I had to find out who that man was, he told his family two days later. They all sat around the oval table in the kitchen, a dwindling stack of tortillas in its baggy husk of butcher paper as the centerpiece, cold coffee in a dented percolator on the tiny stove. When he woke up the next morning, and after eating whatever meager leftovers he could find, he ducked out and went to ask after the man. You could go to the plaza to do that, or to the tendajo, where a mortifying tab was being run, same problem, too, with visiting the butcher. But if you wanted to learn anything about a man the cantina was best. So he had a shot and asked some cuates. No, don’t recognize the name. But they were intrigued and got a cozy feeling drinking with their friend, puzzling out who might know. Some more men came in, but they never heard of the name, either. Soon, the baraja comes out and a round of Carta Blancas appear and the investigation precedes. Hand after hand is dealt, and with the sunlight slanting through the row of narrow rectangular windows atop the high cinder-block walls, a jolliness pervades. Así es que nadie conoce ese nombre? No puede ser, ‘mano. This is a small town. Someone must know him. Somebody has thoughtfully brought a bag of cacahuates, exquisite in their saltiness as coupled with cold beer after cold beer. Somebody has to know. A hard pack of Marlboro, procured in Brownsville, materializes. That American tobacco, nothing like it. A large wreath of smoke drifts to the corrugated-metal ceiling, nearly a thing of reverence as held in the reddening beams of the dwindling day. 

My grandfather has been standing while telling his story, but now he takes a seat at the kitchen table. It took me a while, but I found out, he tells his family. It was deep into the night, the cantina’s windows panes of black, but he was steadfast. A neighbor came in with another man, who it turned out lived one town over. Oye, conocen el nombre de tal y tal? The neighbor didn’t, but the visitor asked him to repeat the name. I know who that is. Did you know him? I told him that man saved my life the other night. If not for him, I would have walked off a cliff. Then you know what he told me? He said, I don’t know who you talked to out there, but that name belongs to a dead man, friend. Can you believe that? Dios le mando a salvarme! 

His daughters gasped, his wife was expressionless. The dead-eyed stare of his son confirmed that it was indeed unbelievable.
